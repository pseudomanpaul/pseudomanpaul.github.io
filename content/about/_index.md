{{< typeit lifelike=true >}} Hi,ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ <strong> Aritrabha </strong> here !! {{< /typeit >}}

I am a twenty year old boy from a town named "Malda" from West Bengal, India. I am currently a third year undergraduate student in Mathematics at Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. My interests are in Probability Theory, Stochastic Process, Statistical Inference.

Apart from academics, I am great foodie! I love to eat, and love to cook as well. I am also fan of <strong>Bengali Rock Music</strong>, but I am quite inclined to other genre as well. I also like to play <strong>First Person Shooter</strong> games, <strong>carrom</strong>, <strong>antichess</strong>, <strong>badminton</strong>, and <strong>cards</strong>. I am really fond of <strong>cardistry</strong>, and I also like to play <strong>literature</strong>, <strong>poker</strong>, <strong>auction bridge</strong>, <strong>contract bridge</strong> and <strong>call break</strong>.
</p>
<p>
I also like to read in my free time, especially <strong>thriller</strong> and <strong>detective</strong> stories, but I have am heavily biased towards <strong>Bengali Story Books</strong>. But if you have book suggestions for me, feel free to drop an email. (But I would expect that at least an English or Hindi Copy of that book would be available!!).
